It's stimulating to do this project.
Enjoy with it.

During this period when I working on the project, I meet a lots of problem. But I also want to say "thanks" to these problem. It help me a lot to enhance my ability in programming.

* Exception Handle
    The training process cost too much time. Sometimes, we have a better idea to change the code into a better version. But the trainning process is going on. If we press `ctrl + c` to interrupt, the data that we have get from the `AdaBoost` process will lost.
    I use a handler for `KeyboardInterrupt` and then save the data of model so that the valuable data won't be lose.
